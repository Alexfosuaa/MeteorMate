# MeteorMate
Created a basic weather web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrating the OpenWeatherMap API for real-time weather data. Key features include:

Search Functionality: Users can input a city name to retrieve and display the current weather.
Current Location Button: Uses the browser’s geolocation API to automatically fetch and show weather details based on the user’s location.
Unit Conversion: Provides options to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius for temperature, and mph and m/s for wind speed.
Dynamic Weather Icons: Displays appropriate weather icons according to current conditions (e.g., rain, clear sky, clouds).
Error Handling: Displays an error message when an invalid city name is entered
